# Components and Functionality Development

## Overview
This section details the responsibilities and guidelines for the development of components and functionality within our React application. The focus is on creating efficient, reusable components and ensuring the application meets functional requirements.

## Directory Structure
- `src/components`: Contains all reusable components.
- `src/page`: Houses the main pages of the application, built using the components.

## Key Files
- `App.js`: The root component that wraps all other page components.
- `index.js`: Entry point for the React application, renders the App component.
- `reportWebVitals.js`: Used for monitoring performance metrics.
- `setupTests.js`: Configures the testing environment.

## Getting Started with Development

1. **Install dependencies**
npm install 

2. **Run the application locally**
npm start

3.  **npm run build**
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
